## 🎯 Goals

  - **Voiceover lines**
  - **On-screen captions**
  - **Visual cues or ideas**

## 🧩 Structure
### 1️⃣ Hook (0:00–0:04)
- Grab attention immediately with a bold or surprising statement.
- Examples:
  - “You’ve been using [COMMAND/FEATURE] wrong…”
  - “This [language/tool] feature doesn’t do what you think.”
  - “The most misunderstood thing in programming is…”

### 2️⃣ Build Curiosity (0:05–0:14)
- Show how most people *think* the topic works.
- Set up the “but…” — the moment before the twist.
- Visual ideas: common mistakes, quick examples, on-screen code snippets.

### 3️⃣ Twist / Reveal (0:15–0:26)
- Deliver the “aha” moment.
- Explain the truth or historical fact clearly in one or two short sentences.
- Visual ideas: old vs. new code, diagram, animation of concept.

### 4️⃣ Outro / Punchline (0:27–0:33)
- Wrap with a satisfying or humorous line.
- Optional moral or reflection (why it matters, why it’s clever, etc.).
- End with a question or CTA (e.g., “Did you know that?” / “Subscribe for more dev trivia!”).

## 🧠 Style Notes
- Tone: **Curious, smart, slightly playful.**
- Audience: Developers, programmers, and tech enthusiasts.
- Keep it **punchy, minimal, and fast-paced.**
- Avoid jargon unless it’s widely known (e.g., “API,” “function,” “variable” are fine).
- Make the **“but” or twist** the emotional peak of the short.
